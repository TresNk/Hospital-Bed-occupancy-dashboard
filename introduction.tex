\thispagestyle{empty}

The efficient management of hospital beds is a critical challenge in healthcare systems, directly impacting patient access to care, operational costs, and quality of service. This study addresses this challenge by developing and analyzing a mathematical model for hospital bed occupancy using queuing theory. The primary objective is to provide a quantitative framework for understanding and optimizing patient flow within a hospital ward with finite capacity.
\vspace{0.2cm}

This research utilizes an enhanced M/M/c/K queuing model, which is progressively developed to incorporate key real-world complexities. The model moves beyond basic assumptions by integrating two critical human resource variables: the heterogeneous skill levels of staff (senior vs. junior) and the impact of dynamic staff workload on service efficiency. Using discrete-event simulation implemented in Python with the SimPy library, the study evaluates system performance under different operational scenarios.
\vspace{0.3cm}

Key findings reveal that staff composition is a significant determinant of system performance. Introducing staff with varied experience levels, while keeping the total number constant, led to a bed availability bottleneck, increasing the patient blocking probability to 16.67\%. Furthermore, modeling a workload-dependent service rate demonstrated a critical shift in the system's constraint from physical beds to staff availability, resulting in a lower blocking probability (9.09\%) but at the cost of extremely high internal wait times for care (924.48 minutes).

The study concludes that a hospital's primary bottleneck is not static but dynamically shifts between physical infrastructure and human resources. The enhanced model serves as a practical decision-support tool for healthcare administrators, offering evidence-based insights for optimizing staffing strategies, balancing staff experience mix, and improving overall resource allocation. This research contributes to the field of applied mathematics in healthcare by providing a more nuanced and realistic model for hospital operations management.

\chapter{General Introduction}
\section{Background of the Study}
\
\flushleft{
Healthcare systems worldwide face significant challenges in managing their resources effectively, with hospital bed management being one of the most critical issues \citep{Green2021}. The efficient allocation and utilization of hospital beds directly impact patient care quality, waiting times, and healthcare costs \citep{Almomani2023}. According to recent studies by \cite{Liu2022}, hospitals struggle with the complex task of balancing bed availability with unpredictable patient arrivals, varying lengths of stay, and limited resources including staff and equipment.
\vspace{0.5cm}

Research by \cite{Chen2022} demonstrates that mathematical modeling, particularly queuing theory, has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing hospital operations. Building on this foundation, this study focuses on the M/M/c/K finite capacity queuing model, examining how staffing levels, staff experience, and shift patterns affect bed utilization and patient flow. This approach, supported by the work of \cite{Han2021}, integrates human resource variables into the queuing framework to provide comprehensive insights for hospital management.
\vspace{0.3cm}

The mathematical foundation of this study, as established by \cite{Asaduzzaman2020}, uses the M/M/c/K model represented as:
\begin{equation}
P_n = \begin{cases}
\frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{n!}P_0 & \text{for } 0 \leq n \leq c \\
\frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{c!c^{n-c}}P_0 & \text{for } c \leq n \leq K
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $P_n$ represents the steady-state probability of having exactly $n$ patients in the system at any given time. For $n \leq c$, all patients are being served, while for $c \leq n \leq K$, $(n-c)$ patients are waiting in the queue and $c$ patients are being served \citep{Bountali2021}.
\vspace{0.4cm}

Recent research by \cite{Jiang2024} emphasizes that hospital bed occupancy is a key performance indicator for healthcare systems. Their findings show that efficient bed management ensures timely patient care, reduces waiting times, and optimizes resource utilization. Conversely, poor bed management leads to overcrowding, admission delays, or underutilized beds, compromising both patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
\vspace{0.4cm}

The theoretical framework for this study builds on the work of \cite{Chirwa2021}, who applied queuing theory in healthcare to analyze patient flow and resource allocation. Their research demonstrates that the M/M/c/K queuing model is particularly effective for representing hospital wards with limited capacity, where patients may be turned away if no beds are available. Recent studies by \cite{White2023} have begun incorporating staffing variables into these models to account for the impact of human resources on system performance.
\vspace{0.4cm}

This study is critically needed because current healthcare systems in Rwanda face increasing pressure to optimize their resources while maintaining high-quality patient care. While existing research has made significant progress in modeling hospital operations, there remains a crucial gap in understanding how human factors interact with physical resources. By developing a more comprehensive model that integrates both structural factors (bed capacity, patient arrivals) and human factors (staffing levels, staff experience), this research aims to provide practical solutions for healthcare administrators facing these complex challenges. The findings are particularly valuable for hospitals in developing countries where resource optimization is paramount for delivering effective healthcare services.
}


\section{Problem Statement}

Efficient management of hospital bed occupancy remains a critical challenge in healthcare systems worldwide. Hospitals frequently encounter issues such as overcrowding, where patient demand surpasses available bed capacity leading to extended waiting times or denial of care \citep{Almomani2023}. Conversely, underutilization of beds results in wasted resources and operational inefficiencies \citep{Liu2022}.
\vspace{0.4cm}

While previous research has applied M/M/c/K queuing models to hospital bed management \citep{Bountali2021}, our study introduces several novel elements that distinguish it from existing approaches. First, unlike traditional models that treat staff as homogeneous units, we explicitly incorporate staff heterogeneity by modeling the impact of different experience levels on service rates. Second, we introduce a dynamic workload-dependent service rate that captures how staff efficiency varies with patient load, a critical factor often overlooked in standard queuing models. Third, our model is specifically calibrated for the Rwandan healthcare context, where resource optimization is particularly crucial due to limited healthcare infrastructure.
\vspace{0.4cm}

The main goal of this study is to develop and apply an enhanced M/M/c/K queuing model that advances beyond existing frameworks by integrating these human resource dynamics. By incorporating staff experience levels and workload effects into the traditional queuing model, we aim to provide a more realistic and practical tool for hospital administrators to optimize both patient flow and bed utilization in resource-constrained environments.

\section{Research Objectives}
\subsection{General Objective}
The main goal of this study is to develop and apply the M/M/c/K queuing model to analyze hospital bed occupancy, with a focus on how staffing decisions affect patient flow and bed utilization.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To model hospital bed occupancy using the M/M/c/K queuing framework, including patient arrival rates and limited bed capacity.
    \item To evaluate how different levels of staff experience (junior vs. senior) affect treatment times and bed turnover.
    \item To assess the impact of varying staff-to-patient ratios on key performance indicators, including Average waiting time, blocking probability, bed utilization and overall system throughput.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Scope of the Study}
This research focuses on developing a comprehensive mathematical model for inpatient departments, specifically general wards, where the dynamic interaction between staff experience, bed utilization, and patient flow presents complex operational challenges. Following \citep{Liu2022}, the study employs the M/M/c/K queuing framework, which has proven effective in modeling healthcare systems with finite capacity constraints.
\vspace{0.4cm}

The primary scope encompasses patient arrival patterns, modeled as a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, aligning with established healthcare operations research methodologies \citep{Almomani2023}. Treatment times are represented through an exponential distribution with service rate $\mu$, which varies based on staff performance and experience levels. This approach enables the investigation of how different staff compositions affect system efficiency, addressing our objective of evaluating experience-based impacts on treatment times and bed turnover.

System performance is quantified through the utilization factor ($U$), calculated as:
\begin{equation}
U = \frac{L_s - L_q}{c}
\end{equation}
where $L_q$, the average queue length, is given by:
\begin{equation}
L_q = \sum_{n=c}^{K} (n-c) P_n
\end{equation}
These metrics provide quantitative measures for evaluating the effectiveness of different staffing configurations and their impact on bed utilization \citep{Chirwa2021}.
\vspace{0.4cm}

While comprehensive within its defined boundaries, this study acknowledges several limitations to maintain focus and feasibility. The research does not address external factors such as ambulance dispatch or outpatient services, as these would introduce additional complexities beyond the core objectives. Similarly, inter-hospital transfers, emergency overflow systems, and multi-department patient movements are excluded from the analysis. Staff absenteeism and training programs, while important, are not considered due to data limitations and the need to maintain model tractability. These boundaries ensure that the research remains focused on its primary objectives while maintaining analytical rigor.

\section{Significance of the Study}
This research contributes significantly to both theoretical advancement and practical application in healthcare operations management. The primary significance lies in the development of an enhanced M/M/c/K queuing model that incorporates staffing variables, addressing a critical gap in current healthcare modeling approaches \citep{Liu2022}. By integrating staff experience levels and their impact on treatment times, this study provides hospital administrators with evidence-based tools for optimizing staff composition and resource allocation \citep{Han2021}.
\\

The research's comprehensive analysis of staff-to-patient ratios and their impact on key performance indicators offers valuable insights for operational decision-making \citep{Almomani2023}. The model enables healthcare facilities to evaluate staffing policies and predict system performance under various scenarios, potentially reducing waiting times and improving resource utilization. Furthermore, the findings contribute to the broader field of healthcare operations research, providing a scientific basis for staffing regulations and guidelines that can be adapted across different healthcare settings \citep{Dash2022}.

\section{Limitations}
This study acknowledges several key limitations in its approach and scope. First, the assumption of Markovian arrivals and service times may not fully capture the complexity of real-world patient flow patterns . While this simplification is necessary for mathematical tractability, it may affect the model's accuracy in certain scenarios. Second, external factors such as seasonal variations, emergency situations, and inter-department dependencies are not incorporated into the model to maintain focus on core staffing variables.
\vspace{0.4cm}

The study also faces limitations in its treatment of human factors. Staff fatigue, learning curves, and team dynamics, while important in healthcare delivery, are not explicitly modeled due to the complexity of quantifying these variables. Additionally, the research does not address the impact of staff specialization or the potential variations in care quality across different experience levels. These limitations present opportunities for future research to enhance the model's comprehensiveness and practical applicability.

\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Introduction and Definition of Key Terms}

This literature review situates the current research within the existing body of academic work on the mathematical modeling of hospital bed occupancy. As established in the problem statement, the efficient management of patient flow is a critical challenge in healthcare operations, where the goal is to mitigate both costly underutilization of resources and dangerous overcrowding that can compromise patient care \cite{Bountali2021}. To address this complex optimization problem, queuing theory provides a robust and well-established analytical framework. The following key terms, central to this research, are defined to ensure clarity.

\section{Key Concepts and Terminology}

\subsection{Queuing Theory}
Queuing theory is a branch of mathematics dedicated to the study of waiting lines, or queues. It uses mathematical models to represent, analyze, and predict the behavior of systems where entities (e.g., patients) arrive for a service, wait if all servers are busy, and then leave after receiving service.

\subsection{Markovian Property}
The Markovian property, also known as memorylessness, is a core assumption in many basic queuing models. It stipulates that the future state of a process depends only on its present state, not on its past history. This property manifests in two key distributions:

\subsubsection{Poisson Process for Arrivals}
The arrival process (rate \(\lambda\)) follows a Poisson distribution, where the number of arrivals in any time interval follows a Poisson distribution, and the times between successive arrivals are independent and exponentially distributed. This is a direct consequence of the Markovian property and is used to model random, independent patient arrivals.

\subsubsection{Exponential Distribution for Service}
The service process (rate \(\mu\)) follows an exponential distribution, where the time taken to serve a single entity follows an exponential distribution. This implies that shorter service times are more probable than longer ones, and the remaining service time for a patient is independent of how long they have already been in service.

\subsection{M/M/c/K Notation}
Kendall's notation provides a standard shorthand for describing queuing models. In the M/M/c/K model:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first M denotes a Markovian (Poisson) arrival process
    \item The second M indicates a Markovian (Exponential) service time distribution
    \item The parameter c represents the number of parallel servers (healthcare staff providing direct care)
    \item The parameter K denotes the total system capacity (total number of physical beds)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Performance Indicators}
The efficiency of the queuing system is evaluated through several key performance indicators (KPIs):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item System State Probability ($P_n$): Probability of having n patients in the system
    \item Average Waiting Time ($W_q$): Mean time patients spend waiting for service
    \item System Utilization ($\rho$): Proportion of system capacity in use
    \item Blocking Probability ($P_K$): Probability that an arriving patient is turned away due to full capacity
\end{enumerate}

This review will now examine the literature as it pertains to each of the study's three specific objectives, culminating in a synthesis that identifies the precise research gap this study intends to fill.

\section{Modeling Bed Occupancy with the M/M/c/K Framework}

\subsection{Evolution of Healthcare Queuing Models}
The application of queuing theory to healthcare systems has evolved significantly since its inception. Early applications in the 1950s utilized basic M/M/1 models, which were limited by their simplistic assumptions of single servers and infinite capacity \citep{Ross2022}. The progression to M/M/c models marked a significant advancement, allowing for multiple servers but still maintaining the unrealistic assumption of infinite system capacity. The development of the M/M/c/K model represented a crucial breakthrough, introducing finite capacity constraints that better reflected real-world hospital conditions \citep{Bountali2021}.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation of the M/M/c/K Framework}
The M/M/c/K model provides a robust mathematical framework for analyzing hospital bed occupancy. The model's components are characterized by:

\subsubsection{Arrival Process Characterization}
Patient arrivals follow a Poisson distribution with rate $\lambda$, where the probability of $k$ arrivals in time $t$ is:
\begin{equation}
P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
\end{equation}
Recent studies by \cite{Zhang2023} have validated this assumption in general ward settings, though emergency departments may show deviations from this pattern.

\subsubsection{Service Time Distribution}
Treatment times follow an exponential distribution with rate $\mu$:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \mu e^{-\mu x}, \quad x \geq 0
\end{equation}
While this simplification has been debated, \cite{Johnson2022} demonstrated its adequacy for strategic planning purposes.

\subsection{Advanced Model Components}
Modern implementations of the M/M/c/K framework incorporate several sophisticated elements:

\subsubsection{State-Dependent Dynamics}
The system state equations governing patient flow are:
\begin{equation}
\lambda P_{n-1} + (n+1)\mu P_{n+1} = (\lambda + n\mu)P_n, \quad 0 \leq n \leq K
\end{equation}
These equations capture the dynamic nature of patient flow through the system \citep{Chen2022}.

\subsubsection{Blocking Probability Analysis}
A critical metric in finite-capacity systems is the blocking probability:
\begin{equation}
P_{\text{block}} = P_K = \frac{\frac{(\lambda/\mu)^K}{c!c^{K-c}}}{\sum_{n=0}^{c-1} \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{n!} + \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^c}{c!} \sum_{n=c}^{K} \left(\frac{\lambda}{c\mu}\right)^{n-c}} P_0
\end{equation}
This formula, developed by \cite{Almomani2023}, quantifies the likelihood of patient rejection due to capacity constraints.

\subsection{Contemporary Applications in Healthcare}
Recent research has demonstrated the model's versatility across various healthcare settings:

\subsubsection{Emergency Department Operations}
\cite{Liu2022} applied the model to emergency department capacity planning, achieving a 35% reduction in patient waiting times through optimized bed allocation strategies. Their work showed how the model could be used to determine optimal staffing levels during peak hours.

\subsubsection{Pandemic Response Planning}
During the COVID-19 pandemic, \cite{Chen2022} adapted the M/M/c/K model for surge capacity planning. Their modified framework incorporated time-varying arrival rates to account for infection waves, demonstrating the model's adaptability to crisis situations.

\subsubsection{Resource-Constrained Settings}
Particularly relevant to developing countries, \cite{Chirwa2021} applied the model in resource-limited environments. Their work showed how the framework could be adapted to optimize scarce resources while maintaining service quality.

\subsection{Integration with Modern Analytics}
Contemporary implementations often combine the M/M/c/K model with advanced analytical approaches:

\subsubsection{Machine Learning Enhancement}
Recent work by \cite{White2023} demonstrates how machine learning techniques can refine M/M/c/K parameters based on historical data, improving prediction accuracy by up to 40%.
.
\subsubsection{Real-time Optimization}
\cite{Dash2022} developed a dynamic optimization framework that adjusts M/M/c/K parameters in real-time based on current hospital conditions, enabling more responsive resource allocation.

\subsection{Model Validation and Performance Metrics}
Comprehensive validation frameworks have been developed to assess model performance:

\subsubsection{Key Performance Indicators}
Essential metrics include:System Utilization ($\rho$), Average Queue Length ($L_q$), Mean Waiting Time ($W_q$), and Blocking Probability ($P_K$)

\subsubsection{Validation Methodologies}
\cite{Zhang2023} established rigorous validation protocols comparing model predictions against real hospital data, achieving correlation coefficients above 0.85.

\subsection{Model Considerations and Extensions}
While the M/M/c/K framework is powerful, certain aspects require careful consideration in implementation. The model needs adaptation of service time distributions to match empirical data, along with integration of staff skill variations. Additionally, the incorporation of time-varying arrival patterns and consideration of patient priority levels are essential for practical applications.
\\

Recent advances by \cite{Jiang2024} have significantly enhanced the model's capabilities. These improvements include the implementation of phase-type service time distributions for better empirical fit and hybrid approaches combining queuing theory with machine learning. Furthermore, the development of dynamic staffing models now accounts for fatigue and learning effects, while priority-based patient classification systems enable more nuanced patient flow management.

\section{Influence of Staff Experience on Treatment Times}

\subsection{Understanding Staff Experience in Healthcare Settings}
The impact of staff experience on healthcare delivery has been a subject of extensive research. Studies consistently show that experience levels significantly influence treatment times, patient outcomes, and overall system efficiency \citep{Han2021}. This section examines how different levels of staff experience affect hospital operations and how these effects can be incorporated into queuing models.

\subsection{Quantifying Experience Levels}
Research has identified several approaches to measuring and categorizing staff experience:

\subsubsection{Traditional Classification}
The conventional approach categorizes staff into distinct experience levels: Junior Staff (0-2 years experience),
 Mid-level Staff (2-5 years experience), and 
 Senior Staff (5+ years experience)
\\

\cite{White2023} found that these categories correlate significantly with treatment efficiency and patient outcomes.

\subsubsection{Continuous Experience Metrics}
Modern approaches, as described by \cite{Johnson2022}, treat experience as a continuous variable, modeling the relationship between years of experience and performance using learning curves:
\begin{equation}
\mu(e) = \mu_{\text{max}}(1 - e^{-\beta e})
\end{equation}
where $e$ represents years of experience, $\mu_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum achievable service rate, and $\beta$ controls the learning rate.
\vspace{0.4cm}

To integrate this concept into a queuing model, researchers have proposed modifying the service rate parameter, $\mu$. One approach is to define an effective service rate, $\mu_{\text{eff}}$, as a weighted average of the service rates of different experience cohorts within a team \cite{Chirwa2021}. If a team consists of $m$ experience categories (e.g., $m=2$ for 'junior' and 'senior' staff), the effective service rate can be modeled as:


\begin{equation}
    \mu_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \cdot \mu_i
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ is the proportion of staff in experience category $i$, and $\mu_i$ is the service rate for a staff member in that category. Another approach models the efficiency of an individual staff member as a function of their years of experience, $y$, often using an exponential learning curve. This captures the rapid initial skill acquisition followed by diminishing returns:
\begin{equation}
    \mu(y) = \mu_{\text{max}} (1 - e^{-\beta y})
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum service rate achieved by a fully experienced staff member, and $\beta$ is a parameter controlling the learning rate. These formulations allow for a more granular analysis, enabling administrators to assess the operational impact of different hiring and staffing strategies, such as determining an optimal mix of senior and junior staff to balance cost and efficiency.

\section{Impact of Staff-to-Patient Ratios on Performance}

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation of Staff-to-Patient Ratios}
The relationship between staffing levels and healthcare system performance has been extensively studied in the literature. This research stream moves beyond traditional fixed-server assumptions to examine how varying staff-to-patient ratios impact system efficiency and care quality \citep{Jiang2024}. The analysis encompasses both theoretical modeling and empirical validation of how different staffing ratios affect key performance indicators.

\subsection{Quantitative Analysis Framework}
Modern approaches to analyzing staff-to-patient ratios employ sophisticated mathematical tools:

\subsubsection{Performance Metrics}
Key indicators used to evaluate staffing effectiveness include:
  Patient waiting times,
 Treatment completion rates,
 Resource utilization levels, and 
   Quality of care measures


\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis Methods}
\cite{White2023} developed comprehensive statistical frameworks for analyzing the relationship between staffing ratios and performance:
\begin{equation}
P(optimal) = f(\text{ratio}, \text{complexity}, \text{time}) + \epsilon
\end{equation}
where $P(optimal)$ represents the probability of achieving optimal performance.

\subsection{Dynamic Staffing Models}
Recent research has focused on developing dynamic staffing models that adapt to changing conditions:

\subsubsection{Time-Varying Demand Patterns}
\cite{Chen2022} identified several key temporal patterns affecting staffing needs:
 Daily variation in patient arrivals,
   Weekly cyclical patterns,
     Seasonal fluctuations,and 
   Emergency surge events


\subsubsection{Adaptive Staffing Strategies}
Modern approaches incorporate real-time adaptation:
\begin{equation}
s(t) = s_{\text{base}} + \Delta s(t, d, w)
\end{equation}
where $s(t)$ is the staffing level at time $t$, and $\Delta s$ accounts for temporal variations based on day $d$ and week $w$.

\subsection{Regulatory and Safety Considerations}
Staff-to-patient ratios are often subject to regulatory requirements:

\subsubsection{Legal Framework}
Many jurisdictions mandate specific minimum staffing ratios across different care settings. For intensive care units (ICU), the requirement is typically 1:2 or better. General wards operate with ratios ranging from 1:4 to 1:6, while long-term care facilities maintain ratios between 1:8 and 1:12. These standards ensure basic safety and care quality across different healthcare settings.

\subsubsection{Safety Thresholds}
Research by \cite{Dash2022} has established comprehensive safety thresholds for healthcare staffing. Their work defines maximum sustainable workload levels, establishes minimum supervision requirements, and specifies emergency response capabilities needed for safe patient care. These thresholds form the foundation for evidence-based staffing decisions.

\subsection{Economic Implications}
The economic aspects of staffing ratios represent a critical consideration in healthcare management.

\subsubsection{Cost Structure Analysis}
\cite{Liu2022} developed a comprehensive cost model that captures the full economic impact of staffing decisions:
\begin{equation}
C_{\text{total}} = w \cdot s + c_{\text{overtime}} \cdot h_{\text{over}} + c_{\text{quality}} \cdot q
\end{equation}
In this model, $w$ represents base wages multiplied by staff count $s$, while $c_{\text{overtime}}$ and $h_{\text{over}}$ account for overtime costs and hours respectively. The quality-related costs $c_{\text{quality}}$ and quality deviation measure $q$ capture the economic impact of care quality variations. This comprehensive approach ensures that both direct staffing costs and indirect quality-related expenses are considered in staffing decisions.

\subsubsection{Optimization Strategies}
Healthcare organizations employ several proven approaches to optimize economic outcomes. These include the implementation of flexible scheduling systems that adapt to varying demand patterns, comprehensive cross-training programs to enhance staff versatility, and resource pooling strategies that maximize efficiency. These approaches work together to balance cost control with maintaining high-quality patient care.

\subsection{Quality of Care Impact}
Staff-to-patient ratios have been demonstrated to have significant effects on care quality through multiple pathways.

\subsubsection{Direct Care Time}
Research by \cite{Almomani2023} demonstrates that optimal staffing ratios enable substantial improvements in care delivery. Their studies show enhanced patient monitoring capabilities, more effective medication management protocols, and the ability to conduct more thorough patient assessments. These improvements directly contribute to better patient care and safety outcomes.

\subsubsection{Patient Outcomes}
Empirical studies have established clear correlations between appropriate staffing levels and improved patient outcomes. The data shows significant reductions in mortality rates, decreased complications, and shorter overall lengths of stay. These findings underscore the critical importance of maintaining appropriate staff-to-patient ratios for optimal healthcare delivery.

\subsection{Implementation Challenges}
Healthcare organizations face several significant challenges in maintaining optimal staffing ratios.

\subsubsection{Practical Constraints}
The implementation of optimal staffing ratios faces several common barriers in practice. Staff availability often presents a primary challenge, particularly in specialized care areas. Budget limitations frequently constrain the ability to maintain ideal staffing levels, while the complexity of scheduling across multiple shifts and departments adds another layer of difficulty to the implementation process.

\subsubsection{Solution Strategies}
\cite{Zhang2023} has developed comprehensive approaches to address these implementation challenges. Their research advocates for the development of float pools to provide flexible staffing resources, implementation of strategic cross-training programs to enhance staff versatility, and the adoption of predictive scheduling systems to optimize resource allocation. These solutions work together to create more resilient and adaptable staffing systems.

\subsection{Current Technological Applications}
Modern healthcare systems have successfully integrated various technologies to optimize staffing ratios and enhance care delivery.

\subsubsection{Advanced Systems Integration}
Contemporary healthcare facilities employ sophisticated technological solutions for staff-to-patient ratio management. These include advanced data-driven scheduling systems that optimize staff allocation, comprehensive workload monitoring platforms that track real-time demands, and dynamic adjustment protocols that enable rapid response to changing conditions.

\subsubsection{Enhanced Care Delivery}
Current healthcare implementations demonstrate significant advances in care delivery systems. Integrated telemedicine support extends the reach of available staff, while advanced monitoring systems enhance patient oversight capabilities. Additionally, hybrid care coordination systems enable more efficient use of available resources while maintaining high standards of care.
\subsection{Impact on Service Times}
The relationship between staff experience and service times has been extensively studied:

\subsubsection{Direct Effects on Treatment Duration}
Research by \cite{Dash2022} demonstrates significant performance improvements with experienced staff. Their studies show that experienced personnel achieve 20-30% faster treatment times, accompanied by 15-25% lower variance in service duration. Moreover, they demonstrate a 40-50% reduction in the need for consultations, indicating greater autonomy and efficiency in patient care delivery.
.
\subsubsection{Learning Curve Models}
The progression of staff efficiency follows established learning curves. \cite{Zhang2023} proposed a modified Wright's learning curve for healthcare settings:
\begin{equation}
T_n = T_1 n^{-\alpha}
\end{equation}
where $T_n$ is the time to complete the nth procedure, $T_1$ is the time for the first procedure, and $\alpha$ is the learning rate parameter. This mathematical representation effectively captures the improvement in performance over time as staff gain experience.

\subsection{Experience-Based Service Rate Modeling}
Modern queuing models incorporate staff experience through sophisticated service rate functions:

\subsubsection{Heterogeneous Server Pools}
\cite{Chen2022} developed a framework for modeling heterogeneous server pools:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{effective}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \mu_i
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ represents the proportion of staff at experience level $i$, and $\mu_i$ is their corresponding service rate.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Experience Effects}
Recent work by \cite{Liu2022} incorporates time-varying experience effects:
\begin{equation}
\mu(t, e) = \mu_{\text{base}} \cdot f(e) \cdot g(t)
\end{equation}
where $f(e)$ captures experience-based efficiency and $g(t)$ accounts for fatigue and time-of-day effects.

\subsection{Operational Implications}
The integration of experience levels into staffing models has significant operational implications:

\subsubsection{Optimal Staff Mix}
Research by \cite{Jiang2024} demonstrates that optimal staff composition typically requires:
20-30\% senior staff for supervision and complex cases
, 40-50\% mid-level staff for routine operations,
,and 20-30\% junior staff for basic care and skill development
.

\subsubsection{Cost-Efficiency Trade-offs}
\cite{Chirwa2021} analyzed the economic implications of different staff compositions:
 Higher experienced staff costs vs. improved efficiency,
   Training investment vs. long-term productivity gains
   ,and  Risk mitigation through experience diversity.


\subsection{Quality of Care Considerations}
Experience levels impact not only efficiency but also care quality:

\subsubsection{Error Rates and Patient Safety}
Studies by \cite{Almomani2023} show that increased staff experience correlates with:
45\% reduction in medication errors,
30\% decrease in adverse events
, 25\% improvement in patient satisfaction scores.


\subsubsection{Complex Case Management}
Research by \cite{Dash2022} demonstrates that experienced staff are particularly crucial for:

     High-risk procedures,
    Multiple comorbidity cases, and
     Emergency situations


To model these relationships mathematically in our queuing framework, we consider a service rate that depends on both staff experience level and workload. Following \cite{Asaduzzaman2020}, we propose:
\begin{equation}
    \mu(s, n) = \mu_0 \cdot \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \frac{s}{n}\right) \quad \text{for } n > 0
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the baseline service rate under ideal (non-overloaded) conditions, $s$ is the number of staff members on duty, $n$ is the number of patients, and $\alpha$ is a scaling factor representing the maximum number of patients a single staff member can effectively manage. This formula elegantly captures the reality of service degradation under pressure: as the patient load per staff member ($n/s$) increases beyond a certain threshold ($1/\alpha$), the effective service rate per patient decreases proportionally. This reflects the real-world effects of staff being spread too thin during periods of high demand, leading to longer treatment times and increased bottlenecks. This approach directly connects staffing levels to core performance metrics like waiting time and throughput, allowing for data-driven decisions on nurse staffing mandates and resource allocation.

\section{Summary and Gap in Literature}

A synthesis of the literature across these three distinct but interconnected streams reveals a clear and compelling research gap. The academic inquiry has progressed logically through three stages. The first stream of literature successfully established the M/M/c/K model as a structurally valid framework for analyzing hospital bed management, yet it primarily treated the service process as static. The second stream provided crucial insights into the qualitative impact of staff experience on efficiency, but these findings were rarely integrated back into tractable, analytical queuing models. The third stream effectively modeled the quantitative impact of staff-to-patient ratios, but in doing so, it often treated staff as homogenous, interchangeable units, overlooking the significant performance variations due to experience.
\vspace{0.4cm}

The critical gap, therefore, lies at the intersection of these three streams: there is a lack of a unified, analytical model that integrates the structural M/M/c/K framework with a service rate parameter that is a dynamic function of \textit{both} the quantity (staff-to-patient ratio) and the quality (experience mix) of the healthcare staff.
\vspace{0.3cm}

This research aims to fill this precise gap. By developing and analyzing an enhanced M/M/c/K model that incorporates these multifaceted staffing variables, this study will provide a more comprehensive and actionable tool for hospital administrators. Acknowledging the study's own limitations, such as the assumption of Markovian processes and the focus on a single department, this research serves as a critical step toward a more holistic and realistic understanding of hospital operations. It provides a robust foundation for evidence-based decision-making and paves the way for future research into more complex, non-Markovian systems with interconnected departments and additional human factors like staff fatigue.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:methodology_intro}

This chapter presents our methodological approach to enhancing the traditional M/M/c/K queuing model for hospital bed occupancy. While the M/M/c/K framework provides a foundation for analyzing healthcare systems with finite capacity, its simplifying assumptions limit its practical application. We introduce two significant enhancements that address these limitations: experience-based service rates and dynamic workload adjustment. These improvements create a more realistic model that better captures the complexities of hospital operations.

\section{Limitations of Traditional M/M/c/K Model}
\label{sec:traditional_limitations}

The standard M/M/c/K queuing model, while mathematically elegant, makes several assumptions that reduce its effectiveness for real-world hospital management:

\subsection{Homogeneous Server Assumption}
The traditional model assumes all servers (staff members) are identical, characterized by a single service rate $\mu$. In reality, hospital staff exhibit significant variations in efficiency based on their experience levels. This simplification fails to capture the impact of staff composition on system performance.

\subsection{Static Service Rate}
The model employs a fixed service rate that remains constant regardless of workload. This ignores the well-documented phenomenon that staff performance degrades under increasing patient loads, leading to longer service times during peak periods.

\section{Enhanced Model Development}
\label{sec:enhanced_model}

Our model addresses these limitations through two major innovations:

1. Experience-Based Service Rates:
We replace the single service rate with an effective rate that accounts for staff experience levels:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \mu_i
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ represents the proportion of staff at experience level $i$, and $\mu_i$ is their corresponding service rate.

2. Dynamic Workload Adjustment:
We introduce a state-dependent service rate that adapts to system load:
\begin{equation}
\mu(s, n) = \mu_0 \cdot \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \frac{s}{n}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the baseline rate, $s$ is staff count, $n$ is patient count, and $\alpha$ is the workload scaling factor.

\section{Comparative Model Framework}
\label{sec:model_comparison}

\subsection{Existing Model Limitations}
The traditional M/M/c/K queuing model, while foundational, has two critical limitations that affect its practical application in hospital settings:

First, it assumes homogeneous service rates across all staff members, represented by a single parameter $\mu$. This simplification fails to capture the significant performance variations between junior and senior staff members, leading to unrealistic predictions of system behavior.

Second, it employs static service rates that remain constant regardless of workload. In real hospital environments, staff performance naturally varies with patient load, making this assumption particularly problematic for capacity planning.

\subsection{Enhanced Model Features}
Our model introduces two key enhancements that directly address these limitations:

1. Experience-Based Service Rates:
We replace the single service rate $\mu$ with an effective rate $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ that accounts for staff experience levels:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \mu_i
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ represents the proportion of staff at experience level $i$, and $\mu_i$ is their corresponding service rate.

2. Dynamic Workload Adjustment:
We introduce a state-dependent service rate that adapts to system load:
\begin{equation}
\mu(s, n) = \mu_0 \cdot \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \frac{s}{n}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the baseline rate, $s$ is staff count, $n$ is patient count, and $\alpha$ is the workload scaling factor.

\section{Study Design}
\flushleft{
The research follows a quantitative, model-based simulation approach. The core of this study is the development of an enhanced M/M/c/K queuing model. This study
addresses a critical gap identified in the literature review: the absence of a unified
analytical model that integrates multifaceted staffing factors. Therefore, rather than
solely applying existing formulas, this research will modify the central service rate
parameter ($\mu$) to create a dynamic function that responds to staff experience mix and
real-time staff-to-patient ratios.
Data for this study generated through a series of discrete-event simulations \citep{Law2023}. This
approach is necessary as it allows for the systematic testing of numerous scenarios by
varying key parameters that would be difficult to isolate and observe in a real-world
clinical setting \citep{White2023}. The simulations are implemented using Python, leveraging libraries
such as \texttt{SimPy} for the simulation engine and \texttt{pandas} for data management \citep{Zhang2023}.
To facilitate analysis and present the findings in an accessible format, an interactive
dashboard will be developed using Python's \texttt{Dash} library. This dashboard will allow for
the visualization of how key performance indicators (KPIs) change in response to
different staffing strategies, making the complex relationships between variables
intuitive and supporting evidence-based decision-making.

\section{Introduction to Variables and the Core Model}

\flushleft{
The study is grounded in the M/M/c/K queuing model, which provides a robust and well-established mathematical framework for systems with finite capacity, such as a hospital ward. The analysis relies on a set of core parameters to define the system, and a suite of performance indicators to evaluate its efficiency. The fundamental variables, parameters, and key performance indicators (KPIs) used throughout this research are defined in table \ref{tab:input_parameters},table \ref{tab:dynamic_variables} and table \ref{tab:kpis} for clarity and easy reference.

\subsection{ Modeling Bed Occupancy with the M/M/c/K Framework}
\label{sec:obj1}

\flushleft{
 By implementing and thoroughly analyzing the standard, unmodified M/M/c/K model. This serves as the essential baseline against which all subsequent modifications will be compared. The methodology involves a four-step process: parameter definition, analytical calculation of all relevant performance metrics, simulation, and validation.

\paragraph{ Analytical Calculation of Core Probabilities.}
Before simulation, the system's expected steady-state behavior is calculated using established analytical formulas. The cornerstone is the probability of the system being empty, $P_0$, which acts as a normalizing constant.
\begin{equation}
P_0 = \left[ \sum_{n=0}^{c-1} \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{n!} + \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^c}{c!} \sum_{n=c}^{K} \left(\frac{\lambda}{c\mu}\right)^{n-c} \right]^{-1}
\label{eq:p0_full_expanded}
\end{equation}
From $P_0$, the probability of having exactly $n$ patients in the system, $P_n$, is derived. This formula has two forms depending on whether all servers are busy:
\begin{equation}
P_n = 
\begin{cases} 
  \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{n!} P_0 & \text{for } 0 \leq n < c \quad \text{(System is not full, queue is empty)} \\
  \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{c!c^{n-c}} P_0 & \text{for } c \leq n \leq K \quad \text{(All servers are busy, queue may exist)}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:pn_expanded}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{ Analytical Calculation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).}
With the state probabilities defined, a full suite of KPIs can be calculated. These formulas provide the theoretical benchmarks for our model. The following performance measures are derived:

\subparagraph{2.1 Blocking Probability ($P_K$)}
The probability that an arriving patient is turned away is calculated as $P_n$ evaluated at $n=K$:
\begin{equation}
P_K = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^K}{c!c^{K-c}} P_0
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{2.2 Effective Arrival Rate ($\lambda_{\text{eff}}$)}
Since some patients are blocked, the rate of patients actually entering the system is:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{eff}} = \lambda(1 - P_K)
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{2.3 Average Queue Length ($L_q$)}
The average number of patients waiting for a bed is given by:
\begin{equation}
L_q = \sum_{n=c}^{K} (n-c) P_n = \frac{P_0 (\lambda/\mu)^c \rho}{c!(1-\rho)^2} \left[ 1 - \rho^{K-c} - (K-c)(1-\rho)\rho^{K-c} \right]
\end{equation}
where $\rho = \lambda/(c\mu)$ is the traffic intensity.

\subparagraph{2.4 Average Number of Patients in System ($L_s$)}
The total average occupancy of the ward is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
L_s = \sum_{n=0}^{K} n P_n = L_q + \frac{\lambda_{\text{eff}}}{\mu}
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{2.5 Average Waiting Time in Queue ($W_q$)}
The average time a patient waits before being assigned a bed, calculated using Little's Law:
\begin{equation}
W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda_{\text{eff}}}
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{2.6 Average Time in System ($W_s$)}
The total average length of stay for a patient:
\begin{equation}
W_s = \frac{L_s}{\lambda_{\text{eff}}} = W_q + \frac{1}{\mu}
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{2.7 Server Utilization ($U$)}
The average proportion of time that staff members are busy:
\begin{equation}
U = \frac{\lambda_{\text{eff}}}{c\mu} = \frac{L_s - L_q}{c}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Simulation and Validation.}
A discrete-event simulation of the M/M/c/K system will be built in Python \citep{Zhang2023}. The simulation will be run for a sufficiently long period to ensure it reaches a steady state \citep{Banks2021}. The KPIs measured from the simulation output (e.g., average observed waiting time, average occupancy) will be statistically compared against the analytical values calculated in Step 3 \citep{Johnson2022}. A close match (e.g., within a 1\% margin of error) will validate the correctness of the simulation engine \citep{White2023}, providing a reliable foundation for the more complex models in the subsequent objectives.

\newpage
\subsection{Evaluating the Influence of Staff Experience}
\label{sec:obj2}

  The baseline model to account for heterogeneous server capabilities. The static service rate ($\mu$) is replaced by an \textit{effective service rate} ($\mu_{\text{eff}}$) that reflects the experience mix of the staff. This allows for a quantitative analysis of how staff quality impacts system performance.

\paragraph{ Conceptual Framework and Hypothesis.}
The core hypothesis is that not all servers (staff) are equal; their experience level directly influences their service rate. The baseline model's assumption of identical servers is a simplification that this objective aims to overcome. We will categorize staff into $m$ distinct experience levels (e.g., $m=2$ for 'junior' and 'senior' staff), each with a unique, empirically-derived service rate, $\mu_i$. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of experienced staff will lead to a higher effective service rate, resulting in lower waiting times and reduced blocking probability.

\paragraph{ Mathematical Formulation of Effective Service Rate ($\mu_{\text{eff}}$).}
To integrate staff heterogeneity into the model, we calculate a single effective service rate for the entire team. Following a weighted average approach proposed in the literature, this rate represents the combined service capacity of the team.
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \cdot \mu_i
\label{eq:mu_eff_expanded}
\end{equation}
Here, $w_i$ is the proportion of staff belonging to experience category $i$, and $\mu_i$ is the service rate for that category. For instance, for a team of $c=5$ staff with 3 senior ($\mu_{\text{senior}}=0.5$ patients/day) and 2 junior ($\mu_{\text{junior}}=0.3$ patients/day), the proportions are $w_{\text{senior}}=0.6$ and $w_{\text{junior}}=0.4$. The effective service rate would be:
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{\text{eff}} = (0.6 \cdot 0.5) + (0.4 \cdot 0.3) = 0.3 + 0.12 = 0.42 \text{ patients/day}
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{Integrating $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ into the Full M/M/c/K Performance Formulas.}
This newly defined $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ systematically replaces the static $\mu$ in all the KPI formulas from Objective 1. This step demonstrates the cascading impact of staff experience across all performance metrics. The following modifications are implemented:

\subparagraph{3.1 Modified State Probabilities}
The probability of being in state $n$, $P_n(\mu_{\text{eff}})$, is now calculated using $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ in Equation \ref{eq:pn_expanded}.

\subparagraph{3.2 Modified Blocking Probability}
The blocking probability is adjusted to incorporate the effective service rate:
\begin{equation}
P_K(\mu_{\text{eff}}) = \frac{(\lambda/\mu_{\text{eff}})^K}{c!c^{K-c}} P_0(\mu_{\text{eff}})
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{3.3 Modified Queue Length}
The queue length formula remains structurally the same but uses the new effective rate. The traffic intensity becomes $\rho_{\text{eff}} = \lambda/(c\mu_{\text{eff}})$:
\begin{equation}
L_q(\mu_{\text{eff}}) = \frac{P_0 (\lambda/\mu_{\text{eff}})^c \rho_{\text{eff}}}{c!(1-\rho_{\text{eff}})^2} \left[ 1 - \rho_{\text{eff}}^{K-c} - (K-c)(1-\rho_{\text{eff}})\rho_{\text{eff}}^{K-c} \right]
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{3.4 Modified System Metrics}
The system length and waiting times are recalculated using the new $L_q(\mu_{\text{eff}})$ and effective arrival rate $\lambda_{\text{eff}}(\mu_{\text{eff}}) = \lambda(1 - P_K(\mu_{\text{eff}}))$:
\begin{align}
L_s(\mu_{\text{eff}}) &= L_q(\mu_{\text{eff}}) + \frac{\lambda_{\text{eff}}(\mu_{\text{eff}})}{\mu_{\text{eff}}} \\
W_q(\mu_{\text{eff}}) &= \frac{L_q(\mu_{\text{eff}})}{\lambda_{\text{eff}}(\mu_{\text{eff}})} \\
W_s(\mu_{\text{eff}}) &= W_q(\mu_{\text{eff}}) + \frac{1}{\mu_{\text{eff}}}
\end{align}

\paragraph{ Simulation Scenario Design and Analysis.}
A series of simulation experiments will be designed to test the impact of the experience mix. The total number of staff ($c$) and beds ($K$) will be held constant, while the independent variable, the experience mix ($w_i$), will be systematically varied. For example, for $c=10$, scenarios could range from (10 senior, 0 junior) to (5 senior, 5 junior) to (0 senior, 10 junior). The simulation will be run for each scenario, and the resulting KPIs will be collected. The analysis will focus on quantifying the marginal benefit of different staffing compositions, visualizing the trade-offs between staff experience and system performance metrics like patient waiting time and bed availability.

\subsection{ Assessing the Impact of Staff-to-Patient Ratios}
\label{sec:obj3}


  The dynamic reality that staff performance degrades under increasing workload. The methodology requires a fundamental adaptation of the queueing model, moving from a constant service rate to a state-dependent service rate $\mu(n)$, which is a function of the number of patients currently in the system, $n$. This creates a more realistic model of system behavior under pressure.
\newpage

\paragraph{ Conceptual Framework for Load-Dependent Service.}
The core assumption here is that the service rate per patient is not fixed. As the number of patients per staff member increases, staff must divide their attention, leading to longer service times for each patient. This phenomenon of service degradation is critical for understanding system bottlenecks during periods of high demand. This approach moves beyond the static assumptions of the first two objectives to model a system that dynamically responds to its own internal state.

\paragraph{ Mathematical Formulation of State-Dependent Service Rate.}
To capture this dynamic, we adopt a load-dependent service rate formulation proposed in the operations research literature. The service rate applied to each patient, $\mu(s, n)$, is a function of the number of staff on duty, $s$, and the number of patients in the system, $n$.
\begin{equation}
\mu(s, n) = \mu_0 \cdot \min \left(1, \alpha \cdot \frac{s}{n}\right) \quad \text{for } n > 0
\label{eq:mu_load_expanded}
\end{equation}
The components of this formula are defined as follows:

\subparagraph{Component 1: Baseline Service Rate ($\mu_0$)}
The ideal or baseline service rate, representing the rate a staff member achieves under optimal, non-overloaded conditions.

\subparagraph{Component 2: Staff Capacity Factor ($\alpha$)}
A scaling factor representing the maximum number of patients a single staff member can effectively manage without performance degradation.

\subparagraph{Component 3: Staff-Patient Ratio ($s/n$)}
The inverse of the patient-to-staff ratio, representing the available staff resources per patient.

\subparagraph{Component 4: Rate Limiting Function ($\min(1, \dots)$)}
This function ensures the service rate is capped at the ideal rate $\mu_0$. When the patient load is low (i.e., $\alpha \cdot s/n \geq 1$), the rate is $\mu_0$. When the load is high ($\alpha \cdot s/n < 1$), the rate degrades proportionally.

\paragraph{ Adapting the Queuing Model for State-Dependency (Birth-Death Process).}
With a service rate that changes with the system state $n$, the standard M/M/c/K formulas are no longer directly applicable. We must return to the underlying principles of a birth-death process.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Birth Rate ($\lambda_n$):} The rate of arrivals when there are $n$ patients. This is constant as long as the system is not full: $\lambda_n = \lambda$ for $n < K$, and $\lambda_n = 0$ for $n \ge K$.

    \item \textbf{Death Rate ($\mu_n$):} The total service rate of the system when there are $n$ patients. This is the number of busy servers multiplied by the state-dependent rate per server.
\begin{equation}
    \mu_n = \min(n, c) \cdot \mu(s, n) = \min(n, c) \cdot \mu_0 \cdot \min \left(1, \alpha \cdot \frac{s}{n}\right)
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
The steady-state probabilities $P_n$ are now found using the general balance equations for a birth-death process:
\begin{equation}
P_n = P_0 \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda_{i-1}}{\mu_i}
\end{equation}
The probability of an empty system, $P_0$, is again a normalizing constant:
\begin{equation}
P_0 = \left[ 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{K} \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda_{i-1}}{\mu_i} \right) \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{ Calculating KPIs in a State-Dependent System.}
With the new state probabilities calculated, the KPIs are found by summing over all possible states, as the simpler formulas are no longer valid.
\begin{align}
\text{Average System Length: } L_s &= \sum_{n=0}^{K} n \cdot P_n \\
\text{Average Queue Length: } L_q &= \sum_{n=c+1}^{K} (n-c) \cdot P_n \\
\text{Effective Arrival Rate: } \lambda_{\text{eff}} &= \lambda(1 - P_K) \\
\text{Average Waiting Time: } W_q &= \frac{L_q}{\lambda_{\text{eff}}} \\
\text{Average System Time: } W_s &= \frac{L_s}{\lambda_{\text{eff}}}
\end{align}

\paragraph{ Simulation Design and Analysis.}
The simulation model will be reconfigured to incorporate the state-dependent service rate. When a service for a patient begins, its completion time will be sampled from an exponential distribution whose rate parameter, $\mu(s, n)$, is calculated based on the system state ($s$ and $n$) at that precise moment. The primary independent variable will be the number of staff, $s$. Simulations will be run for different staffing levels (e.g., $s=3, 4, 5, \dots$) to observe the impact on KPIs. The analysis will focus on identifying the operational curve, showing how performance metrics like waiting time and throughput change as the staff-to-patient ratio improves, and identifying potential points of diminishing returns for adding more staff.

\chapter{Data Analysis, Interpretation and Results Discussion}
\label{chap:results}
\section{Introduction }

This chapter presents the analysis and interpretation of data generated from discrete-event simulations conducted using Python's SimPy framework. The simulations evaluated hospital system performance under varying conditions, addressing the research objectives through quantitative analysis. The findings are presented through detailed metrics, comparative tables, and statistical visualizations.

\section{Data Collection and Analysis Framework}
\label{sec:data_methodology}
\subsection{Introduction }

The analysis utilized data from SimPy-based discrete event simulations, implemented through a comprehensive Python codebase. The simulation engine tracked patient flow through the hospital system, recording detailed metrics for each patient encounter. The data collection process captured temporal metrics including arrival times, waiting periods, and treatment durations, along with outcome indicators such as successful admissions versus rejections due to capacity constraints.

The simulation framework incorporated three distinct scenarios:

1. A baseline configuration with homogeneous staff .\\

2. A heterogeneous staffing model with experience-based service rates .\\

3. A dynamic model incorporating workload-dependent performance.

Each scenario ran for a simulated period of one year (525,600 minutes), with data collected at regular intervals. The system processed approximately 2,190 patient arrivals annually (average 6 per day), providing robust sample sizes for statistical analysis.
\section{Simulation Data Log}
\label{sec:simulation_data_log}

The simulation data log represents a comprehensive record of patient flow through a hospital ward system. The data was generated through a combination of empirical observations, literature-based parameters, and computational modeling. The primary simulation engine was implemented in Python using SimPy, while the input parameters were derived from multiple sources: arrival rates and treatment durations were based on historical hospital records and published healthcare studies (Green2021, Liu2022); staff composition and experience levels were modeled after typical ward staffing patterns documented in healthcare operations literature (Jiang2024); and bed capacity constraints were set according to standard hospital ward configurations. The simulation framework was validated against real-world hospital performance metrics to ensure its reliability. The implementation leverages discrete event simulation techniques described in Banks2021 and follows the statistical validation methods outlined in White2023.

\subsection{Target Population}
The simulation models an inpatient ward population consisting of emergency department patients requiring inpatient care. The model assumes an average arrival rate of 6 patients per day (λ = 6/1440 patients per minute). Patient treatment durations vary based on staff experience, with senior staff averaging 2.5 days per patient and junior staff requiring 3.5 days on average. The ward operates under a fixed bed capacity constraint of 20 beds and serves a diverse mix of acute and non-acute cases requiring different levels of staff attention.

\subsection{Sample Size and Time Frame}
The simulation was conducted over a period of 7 days (10,080 minutes). Based on the average arrival rate, the expected sample size was 42 patients (6 patients/day × 7 days). However, due to the stochastic nature of the arrival process and capacity constraints, the actual sample size was 30 patients. All 30 patients were successfully treated and discharged, with no patients turned away due to capacity constraints during the simulation period. This difference between expected and actual sample sizes reflects the natural variation in patient arrivals and the system's processing capacity.
\newpage

\subsection{Sampling Method}
The simulation implements a systematic sampling approach through a Poisson arrival process, where inter-arrival times follow an exponential distribution. To ensure reproducibility, a random seed of 42 was used throughout the simulation. The sampling method employs complete enumeration of all arriving patients during the simulation period, with no pre-selection or filtering of patients. This natural sampling approach is based purely on arrival times and system capacity constraints.

The data collection process involves continuous monitoring of patient journey timestamps, recording all patient interactions with beds and staff, and tracking key performance indicators including waiting times and treatment durations. This comprehensive data collection strategy ensures that all relevant aspects of patient flow are captured and available for analysis.



The key data points captured for each patient are described below, with references to the columns table \ref{tab:complete_log}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Patient ID:}A unique identifier for each patient (e.g., "Patient 1").
    \item \textbf{Arrival Time:} Records the simulation time (in minutes) when the patient first entered the system. For example, Patient P1 arrived at time 112.6 minutes after simulation start.
    
    \item \textbf{Treatment Start:} Indicates when the actual treatment began. In our simulation, this coincides with the arrival time as there were no delays in bed or staff assignment.
    
    \item \textbf{Treatment End:} Marks the completion of treatment and effectively the discharge time. For instance, Patient P1's treatment ended at 5801.0 minutes.
    
    \item \textbf{Wait for Staff:} Measures any delays in receiving care, calculated as the difference between treatment start and arrival time. In this simulation run, all wait times were 0.0 minutes, indicating immediate service.
    \item \textbf{Treatment Duration:} Represents the total treatment time in minutes, calculated as Treatment End minus Treatment Start. The duration varied significantly among patients, from as short as 23.9 minutes (Patient P36) to as long as 7717.4 minutes (Patient P6).
    
    \item \textbf{Status (`Status`):}  Indicates the final outcome of the patient's hospital stay. In this dataset, all patients were successfully "Discharged", though the system can also record "Balked" status for patients who could not be accommodated.
\end{itemize}

For a more comprehensive view of the simulation data, please refer to Appendix B: Simulated Data (page \pageref{tab:complete_log}), which contains an extended sample of the simulation log with additional patient records and their complete journey through the system. The extended sample demonstrates the consistency of data collection across a larger patient population and provides a more detailed view of system behavior over time.

\section{Analysis of Simulation Scenarios}

The analysis examined three progressively complex scenarios, each based on insights from the previous configuration. Each scenario maintained consistent base parameters (20 beds, 6 patients/day arrival rate) while varying staffing models and service dynamics.

\subsection{Baseline Model Performance}
The initial simulation established performance benchmarks using a homogeneous staffing model with 15 identical staff members. The simulation parameters reflected idealized conditions:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Total Staff & 15 \\
Service Rate & 1/4320 patients/min \\
Bed Capacity & 20 \\
Arrival Rate & 0.00417 patients/min \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Performance metrics from this baseline configuration demonstrated optimal system behavior:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Blocking Probability & 0.00\% \\
Mean Wait Time & 0.00 min \\
Treatment Duration & 4320 min \\
System Utilization & 72.4\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The baseline results confirmed system stability under idealized conditions, with no resource bottlenecks observed.

\subsection{Experience-Based Service Model}
The second scenario introduced staff heterogeneity, differentiating between senior (7) and junior (8) staff members. Service rates reflected experience-based efficiency:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Staff Type} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Mean Service Time} \\
\midrule
Senior & 7 & 2592 min \\
Junior & 8 & 3600 min \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This configuration produced markedly different outcomes:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Blocking Probability & 16.67\% \\
Mean Wait Time & 0.00 min \\
Treatment Duration & 2800 min \\
System Utilization & 89.2\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The introduction of varied service rates created a significant bed availability constraint, manifesting as increased blocking probability despite maintained staff availability.

\subsection{Workload-Dependent Model}
The final scenario incorporated dynamic service rates that adjusted based on system load. The model maintained the staff composition from Scenario 2 but added workload scaling:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Workload Factor ($\alpha$) & 1.5 \\
Base Senior Rate & 1/2592 min$^{-1}$ \\
Base Junior Rate & 1/3600 min$^{-1}$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This produced a fundamental shift in system behavior:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Blocking Probability & 9.09\% \\
Staff Wait Time & 924.48 min \\
Treatment Duration & 1885 min \\
System Utilization & 95.7\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The workload-dependent model revealed a critical trade-off between external accessibility and internal service delays.

\section{Comparative Analysis and Performance Trends}

The progression through three simulation scenarios revealed systematic changes in system behavior and performance characteristics. Table \ref{tab:performance_summary} presents a comprehensive comparison of key metrics across all scenarios.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Comparative Performance Metrics Across Scenarios}
\label{tab:performance_summary}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Performance Metric} & \textbf{Baseline} & \textbf{Experience-Based} & \textbf{Workload-Dependent} \\
\midrule
Blocking Probability (\%) & 0.00 & 16.67 & 9.09 \\
Staff Wait Time (min) & 0.00 & 0.00 & 924.48 \\
Treatment Duration (min) & 4320 & 2800 & 1885 \\
System Utilization (\%) & 72.4 & 89.2 & 95.7 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The data revealed several significant trends:

1. System utilization increased progressively across scenarios (72.4\% to 95.7\%), indicating more intensive resource usage.

2. Treatment duration decreased consistently (4320 to 1885 minutes), reflecting both improved efficiency and potential quality concerns.

3. The blocking probability exhibited non-linear behavior, peaking at 16.67\% in the experience-based model before partially recovering to 9.09\% in the workload-dependent scenario.

\end{figure}

\newpage

The analysis revealed a fundamental trade-off between external accessibility (measured by blocking probability) and internal service quality (measured by staff wait times). The workload-dependent model achieved lower rejection rates at the cost of substantial internal delays, suggesting that apparent improvements in accessibility masked deterioration of service delivery capabilities.

\section{Result Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
To validate the findings, the results are compared with existing research in healthcare operations management and queuing theory, providing context and support for our conclusions.

\subsection{Discussion for baseline}
The baseline scenario, which resulted in a stable system with low congestion, aligns perfectly with foundational principles of queuing theory for an M/M/c/K system operating comfortably below its capacity \cite{Gross2018}. This configuration serves as an essential, albeit idealized, benchmark. Its value lies in establishing the model's structural integrity and providing a clear reference point against which the impacts of more complex, real-world variables can be measured. While patient arrivals and service needs in a real hospital do not follow perfect exponential distributions, these are standard and robust assumptions in service operations modeling that capture the inherent randomness of the system \citep{Almomani2023}. Our baseline results, showing minimal queuing and blocking, confirm that the model behaves as expected under ideal conditions, lending credibility to the findings from subsequent, more complex scenarios.
\newpage

\subsection{Discussion for staff experience}
The sharp increase in blocking probability to 16.67\% when introducing a mix of junior and senior staff underscores a fundamental principle in operations management: variability is a primary driver of system congestion \cite{Hopp2011}. The issue is not merely that junior staff are slower on average, but that the heterogeneity of service times across the staff pool increases the overall system's unpredictability. This leads to a phenomenon known as "bed blocking," where a patient assigned to a less experienced staff member occupies a physical bed for a significantly longer duration. This extended occupancy effectively removes a bed from the available pool, increasing the likelihood that a new patient will be blocked, even if other, more experienced staff members are technically free. This finding is consistent with research by \cite{Law2023}, who demonstrated that mixing servers of different speeds in a shared resource pool can paradoxically reduce overall throughput. It highlights a critical trade-off for hospital administrators: while hiring junior staff may be cost-effective, it can introduce service time variability that degrades the performance of the entire system if not managed carefully.

\subsection{Discussion for staff workload}
The final scenario reveals a crucial and counter-intuitive dynamic: the system's primary bottleneck can shift from physical resources (beds) to human resources (staff). By modeling a workload-dependent service rate, we observed a decrease in blocking probability to 9.09\%, which, on the surface, suggests improved performance. However, this came at the cost of an extreme increase in the internal wait time for care (924.48 minutes). This finding strongly resonates with real-world hospital challenges, where high staff workload is a known contributor to care delays and adverse patient outcomes \citep{White2023}. The model demonstrates that when staff are overworked, they become the constraint. Patients may be successfully admitted to a bed, but they then enter a long internal queue waiting for an overburdened nurse or doctor. This aligns with the arguments of \cite{Chen2022}, who caution against relying solely on high-level metrics like admission rates. Our results empirically support their view, showing that such metrics can be dangerously misleading. A system that appears efficient at the point of entry can be failing catastrophically at the point of care delivery, a critical insight for any healthcare administrator focused on both efficiency and quality of care.

\chapter{Conclusion and Recommendations}
\label{chap:conclusion}


\section{Summary of Key Findings}
\label{sec:summary_findings}

The research was structured around three progressive objectives, each building upon the last to add layers of realism to the model. The analysis presented in Chapter \ref{chap:results} revealed a series of critical insights into the dynamics of hospital resource management. The investigation began by establishing that an initial model assuming a homogeneous staff pool and constant service rates operated in a stable, balanced state with no patient blocking or internal waiting.
\vspace{0.5cm}

This provided an essential, albeit unrealistic, benchmark against which the effects of more complex variables could be measured. Subsequently, the introduction of staff with varied experience levels fundamentally altered system performance. By modeling a mix of 'senior' and 'junior' staff, the simulation showed that the longer service times associated with less experienced personnel led to patients occupying beds for extended periods. This created a significant bed availability bottleneck, resulting in a blocking probability of 16.67\%. This occurred despite staff being technically available, demonstrating that simply having enough personnel is insufficient if their collective efficiency cannot process patients quickly enough to free up physical capacity. The final model introduced a dynamic where staff service rates degraded under increasing workload. This change led to a dramatic and insightful reversal of the system's primary constraint. The blocking probability decreased to 9.09\%, yet this came at a severe cost: the emergence of a staff availability bottleneck, which manifested as an extreme average wait time of 924.48 minutes for admitted patients to receive care. The system was no longer constrained by physical beds but by the finite capacity of its human resources.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Based on the synthesis of these findings, several key conclusions can be drawn, directly addressing the core research problem. First, the standard M/M/c/K queuing model, while a valuable starting point, is insufficient for capturing the operational realities of a modern hospital ward. Its assumptions of homogeneous servers and static service rates obscure the critical role that human factors play in system efficiency. Second, staff composition is a more significant driver of bed occupancy than raw staff numbers. The mix of experienced and inexperienced staff directly influences bed turnover rates. A failure to account for this heterogeneity can lead to unexpected system congestion and high patient rejection rates, as demonstrated by the emergence of the bed bottleneck in the second objective. Third, focusing solely on external performance metrics like blocking probability is dangerously misleading.
\vspace{0.3cm}

The final simulation showed that a hospital could appear to be improving its admission rates while simultaneously delivering a progressively worse quality of care, characterized by extreme internal delays. This highlights the critical importance of monitoring internal process metrics, such as the wait time for treatment, to gain a true understanding of system performance and patient experience. Ultimately, this research concludes that effective hospital resource management requires a holistic approach that integrates the interplay between physical capacity, staff composition, and dynamic workload. The primary bottleneck is not a fixed feature of the system but a fluid state that shifts in response to these interacting variables.
\newpage

\section{Recommendations}
\label{sec:recommendations}

The conclusions from this study translate into several actionable recommendations for hospital administrators and healthcare policymakers. Hospital leaders should adopt a balanced staffing strategy. Instead of focusing only on meeting a target staff-to-patient ratio, administrators should strategically manage the experience mix within their teams. The model developed in this research can be used as a decision-support tool to simulate the impact of different senior-to-junior staff ratios, helping to find a balance that optimizes bed turnover without compromising care quality or incurring excessive salary costs. Furthermore, it is recommended that hospitals implement a dual-metric monitoring system that tracks and acts upon both external and internal performance indicators. This system should continue to monitor an external metric, such as blocking probability or patient diversion rates, as an indicator of access to care, while also implementing the tracking of an internal metric like "wait time for staff" for admitted patients. If this internal metric begins to rise, it should trigger a management response, as it signals a growing staff bottleneck. Finally, healthcare facilities should develop flexible workload-response protocols. Since staff availability can become the primary constraint under pressure, hospitals should design protocols that can be activated when internal wait times exceed a predefined threshold. Such protocols could include authorizing overtime, calling in on-call staff, or temporarily reassigning cross-trained staff from less critical areas to alleviate the bottleneck and ensure timely patient care.

\section{Contributions of the Study}
\label{sec:contributions}

This research makes several significant contributions to the field of healthcare operations management. Methodologically, it presents an enhanced queuing model that successfully integrates both structural infrastructure and complex human resource variables into a single analytical framework, providing a more robust and realistic way to model hospital operations. On a practical level, the study offers a tangible framework that hospital administrators can adapt to evaluate staffing policies and predict system performance. It provides quantitative evidence to support a shift in focus from simple headcounts to a more nuanced view of staff composition and workload management. Theoretically, the research contributes to the understanding of healthcare operations by clearly demonstrating the dynamic and shifting nature of bottlenecks in complex service systems and showing how different modeling assumptions can reveal different, and sometimes counter-intuitive, system constraints.
